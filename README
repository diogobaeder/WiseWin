Window persistence management web library;
Configure multiple windows for desktop-like management,
including tray and position/size management, persisting
the configuration alongside user navigation.

It is based on jQuery, jQueryUI (for fancy dialog boxes)
and EasyData (my data persistence management library).

You may use and change this library as much as you wish,
provided you follow one of the license terms mentioned below.
